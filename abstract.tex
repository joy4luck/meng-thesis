Individuals under unusual stress, whether due to bereavement, illness,
serious conflict, or other transitions can benefit from social support.
Support is a valuable resource,
but there are many psychological and technical obstacles
that can get between an individual
and those he gets support from.

In an effort to compliment and improve upon existing communication strategies,
I designed InMind, an Android application
that mediates a specific form of communication,
shared life-issue tracking,
between close relations.
InMind helps individuals communicate
the status of important topics in their lives,
express their thoughts related to the topics,
and be more aware of these issues for loved ones.

In my thesis work, I conducted interviews and field tested InMind
to explore the social support needs of
these individuals, how are met or not met,
how technology is involved, and consider what can help.
