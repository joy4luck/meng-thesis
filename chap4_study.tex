\chapter{User Study}
To evaluate the relevance of InMind as well as better understand
the social support needs of individuals,
I conducted a user study which was the bulk of the work for this thesis.

In this section, I will describe the goals and protocols of the user study,
and then briefly describe some qualities of the users that participated
in the study.

\section{Study Protocol}
  For this section, I will broadly outline the specific goals
  and practices of this study's protocol.
  For a complete collection of the documents involved,
  the interview scripts, emails, questionnaires, and other exchanges,
  please see Appendix A for a complete collection of materials.
  
  \subsection{Opening Interview}
  The opening interview aimed to answer a few high level research questions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What are some common social support needs of individuals
  dealing with illness, bereavement, or other crises?
  \item In what ways do their current social interactions satisfy
  or fail to satisfy those needs?
  \item How is technology involved?
  \end{enumerate}

  The script of the interview was designed to answer those questions,
  and came in 5 parts.

  In practice, the opening interview was conducted in spaces
  that the participants chose, to maximize their level of comfort.
  The interviewees were encourages to take any tangents they felt
  were relevent or interesting, and thus,
  in addition to learning about their more quantifiable, comparable practices,
  it also become a good opportunity to hear their individual stories.

\section{Data Collection - TBD}
  \subsection{Database}
    Most of the data that is used is directly pulled from
    the InMind server's database.
    The database logs all objects and datatypes,
    along with creation and modification times.

  \subsection{Google Analytics}
    Some of the app timings do not involve contacts with the server.
    I used Google Analytics logging tools to record the time spent
    on each of the views.
