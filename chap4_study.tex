  \subsection{Database}
    Most of the data that is used is directly pulled from the InMind server's database.
    The database logs all objects and datatypes,
    along with creation and modification times.

  \subsection(Google Analytics}
    Some of the app timings do not involve contacts with the server.
    I used Google Analytics logging tools to record the time spent on each of the views.
