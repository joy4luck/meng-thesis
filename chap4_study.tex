\chapter{User Study}
To evaluate the relevance of InMind as well as better understand
the social support needs of individuals,
I conducted a user study which was the bulk of the work for this thesis.

As mentioned in the Overview of the Introduction,
Section \ref{sec:overview},
this study has three different components:
Interviews and Questionnaires,
a Field Test of InMind,
and
Feedback and Reflection on usage fit and evolution.

I will describe the

  \subsection{Questionnaires}

\section{Data Collection - TBD}
  \subsection{Database}
    Most of the data that is used is directly pulled from
    the InMind server's database.
    The database logs all objects and datatypes,
    along with creation and modification times.

  \subsection{Google Analytics}
    Some of the app timings do not involve contacts with the server.
    I used Google Analytics logging tools to record the time spent
    on each of the views.
