  \subsection{Transitions and Social Support}
    From the theme of bereavement, we generalized out to address the stress of transitions.
    Our focus is on the transitions related to bereavement and the diagnosis of chronic illness,
    but there is a broad range of transitions that one goes through,
    over the course of life.

    In general, transitions are a psychological process of reorientation, transformation, adaptation
    that often involve developing new identities and new ways of living
    \cite{kralik_06}
    In light of this definition, transitions are transformative processes,
    which are ultimately important for one's growth.
    However, as looking at bereavement and illness prepared us for,
    transitions have also been associated with increased levels of stress and decreased well being.
    \cite{mikal_13}
    Mikal et. al. in 2013, conducted a survey of different kinds of transitions,
    exploring them through a survey of many different articles addressing transitions and
    the shifts that individuals go through.

    In their survey, Mikal et al categorized transitions into the categories
    individual, family, community, and societal.
    They further discussed how specific types of transitions are either voluntary or not, anticipated or not,
    normative or disruptive, positive or negative, independent or interdependent.
    
    Social support is what people call on to deal with life's difficulties,
    whether it's friends, collegues, families, or anyone else, the people in our lives
    is what helps get us through transitions.

  \subsection{Positive Influences of Social Support}
    Social support is an important resource during times of transition and stress.
    One gets from friends and family support in the form of
    information, material things, and socio-emotional support,
    which are all important in helping one cope with difficulty.
    The impact of this support has manifested itself in a broad range of studies.
    Rains and Young found that supportive communication can help manage uncertainty and
    help one feel in control of one's life \cite{rains_09},
    and Shor et all even discovered that support from
    family is correlated with lower mortality. \cite{shor_13}

    We get agreement in the psychology of bereavement.
    Vachon and Stylianos studied the role of social support in bereavement back in 1988
    and discovered that an inadequate social network is associated with higher distress
    over the course of bereavement,
    and proposed that increasing support can decrease distress.

    However, it is also important to recognize that not all support is the same.
    Lehman et al studied in 1986 the ways that attempts at support that were helpful and unhelpful.
    \cite{lehman_86}
    When Vachon and Stylianos explored the "goodness of fit" between offered support and the actual needs of
    the bereaved, they discovered that it varies wildly, and is sensitive to variables such as impact of loss
    and presence of other stressors.
    \cite{vachon_88}
    
    As the complexity of personal networks suggests, the resources that people pull on
    are very specific,
    and their appropriateness is a complex subject.

  \subsection{Problem: Obstacles to Support}
    Asking for and getting support of any form, it turns out,
    is a significant burden.
    What are the obstacles that stop a person going through a transition and is stressed
    from asking for the help and support that they need?

    There are probably many, but one contributing factor may be that
    people overestimate the burden that they place on another by asking for help,
    and thus underestimate the likelihood that the other will help. \cite{flynn_08}
    Asking for help is often perceived as weakness and powerlessness. \cite{lee_97}

    Other reasons could be that the transition is accompanied by changes in the social structure
    that the support depends upon.
    The situation of illness or bereavement obviously includes, necessarily,
    the loss of an individual that would otherwise be a source of support,
    but many other transitions can also cause rearrangement of personal networks.
    Consequently, during transitions is often when these much needed
    support mechanisms can weaken or fail.
    \cite{mikal_13}

  \subsection{A Role for Technology}
    In light of these obstacles, there's a lot that technology can help with.
    Mikal et al suggest that computer mediated communication (CMC)
    and computer mediated social support (CMSS) can be quickly built up during or in the wake of
    a transition to help an individual cope.
    \cite{mikal_13}
    
    More broadly, interactions through the internet have shown to reduce feelings of depression, loneliness,
    and improve feelings of social support and self-esteem.
    \cite{shaw_02}
    A more recent study showed that even online social networking can improve
    feelings of life satisfaction. \cite{hjo_14}

\section{Related HCI Work}
  \subsection{Chronic Disease Support}
    The most active community developing software for social support is,
    not surprisingly, in the realm of support for chronic diseases.

    In 2010, Skeels et. al used a participatory design methodology to explore what is most useful
    to breast cancer patients.
    With breast cancer survivors and their friends, Skeels et al. compiled a model for how
    suggestions and requests for help can be compiled and managed by patients \ref{fig:skeels_diagram},
    and collected all the many barriers to social support that are common for breast cancer patients.
    The prototype technology they implemented was a website, supported by Facebook Connect,
    that allowed patients to perform those request/help idea management tasks.
    
    In 2011, Granholm et. al designed a mobile intervention,
    effectively a text messaging service, that helped patients diagnosed with
    schizophrenia.
    The text messaging service effectively texted the patients 4 times a day,
    asking questions or giving them a suggestion.
    The results showed significant improvement for medication adherence for those living alone,
    and improvements in socialization and a decrease in auditory hallucinations. \cite{granholm_12}

  \subsection{Communication Technologies}
    When it comes to the practical aspect of designing for interpersonal
    communication, researchers in family interactions have significant experience.
    Designing technologies for a multi-person group is unusual because the usual
    standards of usability need to be applied to the unit as a whole, and not just
    the experience of a particular individual. \cite{neustaedter12}

    I am interested in technologies classified as "interpersonal awareness systems,"
    designed to be used by families and couples that are separated by distance.
    Systems like this help people maintain awareness of  of each other to connect
    and comfort each other. \cite{neustaedter06}
    In 2004, Markopoulos designed and tested an
    awareness system for families that shared pictures and snippets from a mobile
    device, demonstrating the value of mediating that connection through technology.
    \cite{markopoulos04}
    My theory is that the support of intimate family relations is a powerful
    resource that could
    have a very positive influence on the experience of stressed individuals.
