\chapter{System Overview}
  \section{Broad Design Goals}
  The system designed to address a subset of these concerns is essentially a mobile application.
  I designed and implemented,
  from the ground up, an application called InMind.
  InMind would enable the sort of slow,
  targeted communication that had been useful to bereaved individuals in forums,
  but connect individuals with people that they choose.

  Broadly, the goal of the application was to enable users to create spaces
  with themed topics, that had a status of some nature.
  This status could represent the user's well being, the well being of someone else
  that the user cares about, the progress of a project, the energy level of a group,
  the level of anxiety the user is suffering from, etc.
  Since mobile applications are always accessible,
  these themed spaces could be updated at any point
  during the day when the status of that topic changes.

  Finally, since individuals have shown to be sensitive
  to which particular people they share
  sensitive topics with \cite{},
  the users can choose when they begin the topic
  which of their people they want to share with.

  To summarize, once shared, the topics would be defined by several characteristics:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Title} - Answers the question of \textbf{What}. The user can choose what to call the topic.
  \item \textbf{Share With} - Answers the question of \textbf{Who}.The topic is like a static chatroom,
    since the people who are listening in are always the same.
  \item \textbf{Status} - Answers the question of \textbf{How}. The "status icon" of the topic sets the mood
    of the topic. Unlike for chatrooms,
    this status allows the space to reflect the state
    of the user who started the topic.
  \end{enumerate}

  Within those spaces, we wanted to encourage communication.
  Here, although I was inspired by the nature of online forums,
  where many people reach out for support,
  our goal was more influenced by the nature of mobile communications.
  On a mobile device, users expect to use abbreviated conversation.
  Although the thoughts may be complex, the messages composed on a mobile device
  tend to be very short.

  \section{Application End}

    \subsection{Platform Choice}
    The application was written for Android, targeting API 18,
    but supports down to API 13.

    I chose to develop in Android partially because the Affective Computing Group
    has a recent tradition for doing so.
    This is for reasons related variously to the freedoms that Android developers have,
    and the availability of third party software toolboxes for Android.
    However, my primary reason for choosing Google Android over Apple iOS is
    the prevalence of Android devices.
    Android has been dominating the mobile market since 2012,
    and if InMind were to be released to the public,
    an Android application is more likely to reach out to a broader audience.

    The InMind application supports API 13 through 18, 
    corresponding, respectively, to Android 3.2 Honeycomb and 4.3 Jellybean.

    Android 4.3, Jellybean, was released the year ago, but is by far
    the most prevalent in the MIT target population due to the devices
    that supported it sold over the course of the year.
    During development, Android 4.4, KitKat is being pushed out to devices,
    but yet isn't available to a significant degree.

    At the opposite end, API 13, was released with Android 3.2 HoneyComb
    in 2011, 3 years prior to this date of writing.
    Mobile devices have a life span of about two years,
    and thus it is unlikely for Android users to be
    running versions of Android older than API 13.

    \subsection{Hardware}
    InMind has to integrate into a user's existing communication methods,
    as that is the environment actually encountered in the lives of people.
    Thus, emulating more typical applications,
    InMind is designed to be installed onto the user's existing mobile device.

    As previously suggested by the range of compatible Android versions,
    InMind is designed to be run on an assortment of devices.
    
    In addition to version issues, Android devices vary significantly in form factor.
    The two most popular are cell phone-like devices, which have roughly a 4" screen,
    and small tablets, which have roughly a 7" screen.

    I developed primarily on two devices, a Samsung S4, with a 4" screen,
    and a 2012 Nexus 7, with a 7" screen.
    Design objectives for all layouts was to be attractive on the cell-phone-sized screens,
    and reasonably functional on larger tablet screens.

    \subsection{Application Structure}
    The interactive part of the application is best described by a description of the views
    and the actions available to the user on them.
      \subsubsection{Home Page}
      The home page shows the topics that the user has access to.
      See \cite{} for a series of screenshots of the home page design.

      Since the iconography of the topics is very important,
      the main page gathers the icons of the topics in a scrolling view.
      Each topic is labeled with its title and owner.
      Whenever a topic is updated, whether with a message from someone,
      or with a status change, everyone who can see the topic will see the topic
      lit up with a yellow glow, indicating that there is something to see under that topic.

      As the number of topics increases,
      it becomes increasingly important to have a way to organize the topics.
      I chose to implement this in the form of filters.
      The filters are available in a dropdown menu in the action bar at the top of the screen.
      (The second screenshot in \cite{})
      There are three default filters that always filter for topics that meet certain criteria.
      The first two are "Mine" and "Shared with Me"
      which filter for, respectively, topics the user has created and those he did not.
      The last is "Archived" which shows only the archived topics.
      Archived topics do not appear in any other filtered view.

      Finally, the user can create their own filters.
      The filter creation page is shown in \cite{}.
      The freedom to create their own filters allows users to organize
      their topics however they like.
      Some ideas include bringing out topics that are particularly important,
      particularly serious or un-serious, created by specific people,
      or even filtering by higher level themes.

      Since the topics and their corresponding messages may be private in nature,
      possibly even more private than the other material storied on the device,
      there is an option of logging out.

      The log out option is available under options.
      When a user logs out, all the application data stored on the device is wiped.
      This makes it impossible for anyone to get access to that user's
      messages or topics without authenticatin as that user.
      Conversely, on successful login, all the data is re-downloaded onto the device.

      \subsubsection{Creation View}
      When a user want to initiate the topic,
      they can click the add button on the action bar at the top of the home page.
      This opens up the creation view, which is shown in \cite{}.
      On this page, the user titles the topic,
      chooses an icon, and chooses who to share the topic with.

      The choice of the icon is very important in setting the theme of the topic.
      First, let me explain the structure of InMind status icons.
      The icons are of three kinds: plants, birds, and hampsters.
      All three icons are of a similar structure, and have two parts.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item A background color, to make the icon distinct from others like it.
      \item A "character" icon, whose status changes between 5 to 8 different levels.
      \end{enumerate}

      As previously mentioned, the icon is very important in setting
      the theme for the topic, since its state represents the status of the topic
      in reality.
      The design of the icons is very important in influencing how
      the users interact with the topics. 
      There are three kinds of icons, and they represent three types of statuses.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Plants} grow in a colored pot. They are a good general purpose icon as they are neutral,
      not personable, and a familiar icon in many other settings,
      since they are associated with positive feelings of growth.
      \item \textbf{Birds} are positioned relative to a colored water level.
      They indicate affective wellness or degree of success in the face of difficulty.
      \item \textbf{Hampsters} run on a colored exercise wheel.
      Their speed can represent arousal,
      or associated energy levels for the topic.
      \end{enumerate}
      The progression of icons is completely detailed in the appendix.

      The symbology was unclear to early beta testers,
      suggesting that choosing an appropriate icon for a topic can be difficult.
      The topic creation page helps by providing
      a short blurb to describe how to use each icon type.

      \subsubsection{Topic View}
      From the home page,
      the user can select a topic to jump to that topic's page.
      Screenshots of the topic page can be see in \cite{}

      The topic page is primarily modeled after a chatroom,
      or more common on the mobile device platform,
      a text message log.
      The previous messages in that topic are displayed on the main view,
      in reverse chronological order, similar to most chatroom and text message application.

      A button near the top toggles the appearance of a panel that shows data and controls
      related to the topic.
      The data panel has a text section with the topic creation date and who the topic is shared with.
      The current icon for the topic is shown, as expected, as are 3 buttons for controls.

      With the first two buttons,
      the owner of a topic can increase or decrease the state of the icon.
      These changes are logged in the message logs,
      so that people with whom the topic has been shared with
      can also track the status of the topic.

      The last button allows the owner to archive a plant,
      effectively freezing the plant and constraining it to the archive view.
      Archived plants also have a similar view,
      but the status change and messaging capabiliies are disabled.
      Archived plants provide a record of interactions,
      but cannot be interacted with further unless they are brought out of the archive.

      \subsubsection{Prompts and Notifications}
      InMind has two other visible features.

      Below the scrolling view of topics that displays the topics
      that match the filter, there is a small box that displays the prompts of the day.
      The prompts change every day, and are displayed in discreet plain text.
      The prompts are designed to help encourage creative topic creation.

      Further, since the prompts change every day,
      and there is always something to consider, InMind has a daily notification system.
      After 24 hours of inactivity, a notification appears on the mobile device,
      reminding the user to check InMind for the day's prompt.

    \subsection{Security}


  \section{Server}
    \subsection{Design}
      The server for InMind was written using Node.js.
      The choice of Node.js offered many benefits, including asynchronous responses,
      lightweight maintenance, and easy integration with MongoDB for data retention.

      MongoDB gave us flexibility for designing how we wanted data to be stored,
      and we took advantage of MongoDB\'s simple backup mechanism for data integrity.

      The data saved on the server included records of all the app interactions.
      For each of the actions performed by the users,
      we logged the timestamp of the operation as well as the recipients.

      To keep user data secure, the server was hosted on an MIT Media Lab server.
      The machine... TBD

    \subsection{Security}
      During the study, while the server was running, it was password protected,
      as was the database in which the data was stored.

      For added protection for our users, all messages were encrypted.
      This encryption was on several levels, primarily using the AES standard.
      TBD

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item To protect user identities, signup for the lead participant was performed manually.
      All "lead" participants had to be entered into the database manually,
      and later participants sign up anonymously with a user id and password.
      Data on all users are deidentified;
      the database remembers only an alphanumeric user id.
      \item Each group shares an initialization vector.
      \item Each topic has a salt and an autogenerated passphrase.
      \end{enumerate}
